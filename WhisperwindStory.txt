Hear ye, hear ye, adventurers of renown and valor!
       You are hereby summoned to embark on an extraordinary journey within the world of DND 5th Edition. Your first quest 
begins with the creation of a character whose destiny is intertwined with the enchanting town of Whisperwind and the 
mysterious Feywood Forest that borders it.
Character Creation Call to Action:
*	Backstory: Weave a narrative of at least one page that chronicles your character's life before their fateful arrival in 
Whisperwind. Delve into their experiences, ambitions, and the pivotal moments that have shaped them.
*	Physical Appearance: Detail your character's visage, attire, and the bearing they present to the world.

Whisperwind and the Feywood Forest:

resilient as the towering trees that guard its periphery. It is a place where tales of magic and mystery drift through the
